Entitifier
===========

This is my first foray in to Ruby and Sinatra development hence the code is probably horrific. I intend to keep updating it as I learn more about both the language and the framework but I hope the actual functionality is useful and am always open to suggestions on how to improve it. Get in touch via Twitter: [@sam_bowler](http://twitter.com/sam_bowler).

This project wouldn't have been possible without:

- [Sinatra](http://wwww.sinatrarb.com)
- [Hpricot](http://hpricot.com)

Known issues
-----------

- Dealing with inline language tags such as <?php ?> or <%= %>
- Hpricot doesn't like HTML5 elements
